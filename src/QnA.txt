1. What is the purpose of the key value, which must be given to individual rows in a react-list
    
    The purpose is to that react can tell which element we have changed and therefore change that element.'

2. It's recommended to use a unique value from your data if available (like an ID). How do you get a 
unique value in a map callback, for data without a unique id?

    YES IT'S RECOMMENDED! how? here:
    function TableItem({ members }) {
        return (members.map((m, index) => <tr key={index}><td>{index}</td><td>{m.name}</td><td>{m.age}</td></tr>));
    }
    by using "index" in the map call or by using m.id if members have an id.

3. What is the difference(s) between state and props?
    
    props are read-only, state is dynamic

4. For which scenarios would you use props, and for which would you use state?

    i would use props when i need to read values only, and use states when i need to change something.

5. Where is the only place you can set state directly as in:  this.state = {name: "Peter"};

    In the contructor.

6. How must you set state all other places?
   
    this.setState({
                numbers: newArray
            });

1. In a Controlled Component React state is made the "Single source of truth", so how:
    
    a. Do we ensure that input controls like text, textarea or select always presents the value found in the components state?


    b. Do we ensure that a controls state, always matches the value found in an input control?


2. What is the purpose of doing event.preventDefault() in an event handler?

    Its to prevent something from happening, ex. preventing a submit button to submit.



3. What would be the effect of NOT doing event.preventDefault in a submit handler

    The submit will work?


4. Why don't we want to submit the traditional way, in a single page application?

    ?


5. What are the two different ways we can use to make this works as expected for our event handlers?




6. Explain in words what it takes to implement the "Controlled Component" pattern for a form

1. What is meant by the react term “Lifting State Up”?

    As React docs state
    Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their 
    closest common ancestor.
    There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application.
    Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. 
    Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. 
    Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.


2. Where do you lift it up to?

    The closest common ancestor.


3. Which way does React recommend data to flow: From sibling to sibling, from bottom to top or from top to bottom?

    Top-down data flow.


4. Lifting state up, involves a great deal of boilerplate code, what’s the benefit we get from doing “things” like this?

    It takes less work to find and isolate bugs.
